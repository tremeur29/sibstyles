* sibelius house styles
House styles for Sibelius for syncing across my computers.
** Contents
*** =norfolk.lib=
old style which I don’t really use these days, adaptation of the original [[https://www.nycmusicservices.com/musicresources/][Norfolk house style]]
- Norfolk music fonts
- TeX Gyre Schola text font
- A♯ transposition
- weird page number placement
*** =plagiarium.lib=
loosely based on my impression of [[https://www.scoringnotes.com/reviews/sibelius-2020-1/][Podium]] from a single .png file because I don’t want to pay for Sibelius 2020, plus some features of published scores
- Helsinki music fonts with thicker lines
- TeX Gyre Pagella text font
- A♯ transposition for more instruments
- some more percussion instruments (currently: hi-hat, suspended cymbal)
- non-musicy tuplet numbering
